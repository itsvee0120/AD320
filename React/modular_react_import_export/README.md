# React App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates the basic structure of a React app with components. It includes a header, main content section with two components (`ContentA` and `ContentB`), and a footer.

## Project Structure

```
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── Header.js
  │   ├── Footer.js
  │   ├── ContentA.js
  │   └── ContentB.js
  ├── App.css
  └── App.js
```

- **App.js**: The main entry point of the application. It renders the `Header`, `ContentA`, `ContentB`, and `Footer` components.
- **App.css**: The CSS file that styles the application.
- **Header.js**: A component for displaying the header section of the app.
- **Footer.js**: A component for displaying the footer section of the app.
- **ContentA.js**: A component for displaying the first section of the main content.
- **ContentB.js**: A component for displaying the second section of the main content.

## Features

- A header section at the top of the page.
- Two content sections (`ContentA` and `ContentB`) that can be customized or extended.
- A footer section at the bottom of the page.
